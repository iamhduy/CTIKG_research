Weevely is a command line weaponized PHP web shell dynamically extended over the network at runtime and is designed for remote administration and pen testing. It provides a telnetlike console through a PHP script running on the target, even in restricted environments.
The low footprint agent and over 30 modules shape an extensible framework to administrate, conduct a pentest, postexploit, and audit remote web accesses in order to escalate privileges and pivot deeper in the internal networks.

The remote agent is a very low footprint PHP script that receives dynamically injected code from the client, extending the client functionalities over the network at runtime. The agent code is polymorphic and hardly detectable by AV and HIDS. The communication is covered and obfuscated within the HTTP protocol using steganographic techniques.

"Popular webmail provider Yahoo has been slammed with a new emailbased attack that seizes control of victims accounts. Bitdefender Labs discovered the ongoing campaign today and are once again warning users about the dangers of clicking spammy links.
The account hijacking begins with a spam message with a short link to an apparently harmless session of the reliable news channel MSNBC (hxxp://www.msnbc.msn.comim9.net[removed]).
A closer look at the real link reveals that the true domain is not part of MSNBC, but a crafty domain composed of subdomains at hxxp://comim9.net.
The domain was registered in Ukraine on Jan 27 and is hosted in a data center in Nicosia, Cyprus. This page contains a piece of malicious JavaScript, disguised as the popular Lightbox library that will perform the attack in stage 2.
Before we proceed, lets see what cookie theft is all about: security on the web is based on what we call the sameorigin policy, a complex mechanism that wont allow Site A to access resources of Site B, such as cookies. Cookies are small snippets of text created when the user logs into a system, and they are used to (among other things) remember that the account holder has already passed the authentication once. Otherwise, the user will have to log in whenever they read another email or when they navigate from one page to another. So, in this context, it is obvious that a piece of code running on Site A cant steal a cookie set by Site B. However, a subdomain of Site B can access the resources of Site B, and this is what the attackers did.
The second stage of the attack is focused on the Yahoo Developers Blog (developers.yahoo.com), which conveniently uses a buggy version of WordPress . More to the point, they exploit the SWF Uploader of the WordPress platform at http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/wpincludes/js/swfupload/swfupload.swf. It has a security flaw known as CVE20123414 (by the way, it has been patched since WordPress version 3.3.2).
Since it is located on a subdomain of the yahoo.com website, all the attackers need to do is trigger the bug and pass a command that steals the Yahoo cookie (with the login data, for instance), and then send it home.
At this point, miscreants have full access to the victims contact list until the current session expires or the user logs out. Crooks will either spam the contacts in the stolen lists (which may include friends, family, business contacts, professors) or use these contacts to send spam emails and/or malware in the name of the crook.
Why is your account important for crooks? If you are asking yourselves why crooks take an interest in your email accounts and harvest the email addresses of your friends, the answer is simple. To send more spam on your behalf.
Miscreants cannot register accounts automatically on webmail providers such as Yahoo, Google, Hotmail and the like because registrants need to fill in CAPTCHA. It takes time, and real people, to type the signs in. That, in turn, costs money. Stealing active accounts is a costeffective way for an operator to automate attacks and, at the same time, allows them to read your contacts and get more victims.
Whats to be done?Log out from your email accounts every time youre done reading or writing your emails.Never click on links in spam emails.Keep your antivirus and software updated.Attack description provided by malware researchers Razvan Benchea and Octavian Minea.All product and company names mentioned herein are for identification purposes only and are the property of, and may be trademarks of, their respective owners. agsmalicious link MSNBC slider spam email xss Yahoo account
